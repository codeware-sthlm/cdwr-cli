# Description

This is a CLI to make local development a bit easier and structured. Some commonly used tools and scripts are bundled and provided by CLI commands.

Though it's a public repo this CLI is aimed for Codeware Sthlm developers. If anyone finds it useful we're more than happy to share our code, or the CLI itself from NPM.

# Recipes

## Setup a local npm registry using verdaccio

```sh
# Start verdaccio
cdwr registry start

# Change your local registry setting to use the verdaccio host
cdwr registry set local

# Check status
cdwr registry status
```

Now a deploy to npm via `npm publish` should end up in verdaccio repository.

The repository content is accessed via <http://localhost:4373>.

```sh
# Stop verdaccio
cdwr registry stop

# Check status again
cdwr registry status
```
